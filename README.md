# English
English is an esolang made to make "code" more readable,
Check out src/Main.java to execute some code, Are you new here? If yes then check out the examples!

# What's new in v1.3.0?
* run external scripts!
* fixed a bug
* some minor changes in the interpreter
* more examples

# How to use
```java English en = new English( [bool: extra variables], [bool: debug] );```<br/>
And then you can now run a whole "script" with ```en.RunCode( [String: code] )``` or
just run one line with ```java en.Execute( [String: code] )```

# Cool stuff about this
* Declare variable names with spaces
* Read files
* 100% Human readable code, unless you can't understand english ;)
## All the stuff you can do
* Addition (math will be implemented soon)
* Variable names with spaces
* Read files
* if statements (==,>=,<=,>,<,~=)
* variable declaration (all variables declared will be global!)
* get the length of a string
* the while loop
* run a script,<br/>
```run script /path/to/file.en<br/>say the script output```

# These are for v2.0.0:
* Functions!
* Math
* File operations, Make folder, delete file/folder etc.
* "our first variable" will be an object, (our>first>variable)
* Connection to the internet like Requesting a webpage or an url to get data, Sending post requests etc.
* (possibly) Add her/its/his "keywords"
* (possibly) Connection to WebSockets
* (possibly) Arrays
* (possibly) Text manipulation/finding ( replace, replaceAll, indexof, startswith, endswith, etc. )
